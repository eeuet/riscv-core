# RISC-V UET three stage

This is my graduation project of a simple RISC-V 5 stage pipeline processor. I have implemented 38 instructions of the basic RV32I ISA, except the instructions support the operating system.

Instructions include arithmetic and logic instructions, load and store instructions, conditional branch instructions, jump and link instructions and LUI, AUIPC. No operation instruction is also support.

Features:

- 5 stage pipeline processor
- No structural hazards
- Resolve data hazards using forward and stall
- Branch predict unit using global 2-bit saturating counter scheme

The simple M-mode exception handling, please refer `Simple-M-mode-Exception-Handling` branch: https://github.com/Groupsun/riscv-mini-five-stage/tree/Simple-M-mode-Exception-Handling

## Project structure

- `src/main/scala/riscv_mini_five_stage`: source code of the processor
    - `Addr_Buffer.scala`: a small register file recording the address that need to recover from branch predict failure.
    - `ALU.scala`: Arithmetic and logic unit of the processor.
    - `Branch_Predict.scala`: Branch predict unit of the processor.
    - `Config.scala`: Global config parameters of the processor, not the actual hardware component.
    - `Control.scala`: Main control unit of the processor.
    - `DataCache.scala`: Data cache of the processor.
    - `Datapath.scala`: Datapath of the processor, include all the logic gates out of the functional unit.
    - `Encoding.scala`: A simple program translates the assembly code to binary code, not the actual hardware component.
    - `EX_MEM_Register.scala`: Pipeline register between EX and MEM stage.
    - `Forward.scala`: Forward unit fo the processor.
    - `Hazard_Detection.scala`: Detect the hazards that need to stall the processor.
    - `ID_EX_Register.scala`: Pipeline register between ID and EX stage.
    - `IF_ID_Regsiter.scala`: Pipeline register between IF and ID stage.
    - `ImmGen.scala`: Generate the immediate from the instructions.
    - `InstCache.scala`: Instruction cache of the processor.
    - `Instructions.scala`: Define the instructions and their bitpat of RV32I, not the actual hardware component.
    - `MEM_WB_Register.scala`: Pipeline register between MEM and WB stage.
    - `PC.scala`: Program counter of the processor.
    - `RegFile.scala`: Register file of the processor.
    - `Tile.scala`: Top level of the processor, connects all the functional component.
- src/test/scala/riscv_mini_five_stage_test: unit test of the processor.
    - `Tile_Test.scala` generates the test result of the program written in initmem/asm_input.txt.

### Generate verilog

Running `src/main/scala/riscv_mini_five_stage/Tile.scala` Tile object

### Input test program

**This is an experimental feature**

Write your assembly code in initmem/asm_input.txt.

Format:

- Op must be upper case
- Register name must start with 'x'
- Immediate must start with "0x", Hex format

```
R-type :   Op    rd , rs1, rs2
I-type :   Op    rd , rs1, imm
S-type :   Op    rs2, rs1, imm
U-type :   Op    rd , imm
SB-type:   Op    rs1, rs2, imm
UJ-type:   Op    rd , imm
No operation just type "NOP"
```

The output file is `initmem/instcache.txt`, Hex format. Each line represents a Byte in instruction cache.

### Write your own Chisel test branch

Open `/src/test/scala/riscv_mini_five_stage_test/`, create your own test source file and begin.

You may need to refer https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers to learn how to write your own Chisel test branch.
